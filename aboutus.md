### About us
The biomedical research group focuses on developing artificial intelligence algorithms based on natural language processing and bioinformatics for text mining. Committed to building unstructured, massive biomedical and clinical data into a structured biomedical knowledge graph. At the same time, it is committed to research in the field of medical big data, using large-scale data mining and machine learning algorithms to conduct in-depth analysis of medical data, and using artificial intelligence technology to assist doctors in the diagnosis and treatment process.

Research on the application of deep learning methods on clinical data, digital pathology image analysis, clinical structured data analysis and pathology semantic standardization. The entire team has published three papers in top conferences and journals such as ACL, AAAI, SIGKDD, NeuralPS, ACM CIKM, MICCAI, IEEE TMI, IEEE TKDE, MedIA, Bioinformatics, JBHI, IEEE BIBM, IEEE ICDM, SDM, ISBI, JMIR, Scientific Data, etc. More than ten articles. Cited thousands of times on Google. In 2016, the team won first place in the SeeDev task in the BioNLP data mining competition participated by top international research institutions such as the University of Cambridge. The team has undertaken a number of major national, provincial and ministerial level scientific research tasks and achieved representative scientific research results. It has applied for more than 50 invention patents and software works. The team's project results are used in major projects such as the National Health Commission and the National Medical Informatization Process Survey, as well as in daily diagnosis and scientific research in multi-level medical institutions. Among them, the BioModels biological pathway knowledge map and system has been rated as the most important resource in the field of systems biology, and has been included in the development of the European Bioinformatics Architecture Initiative (ISBE) by the European Union as a successful case.

### Research
Making sense of data is possibly the biggest problem in Neuroscience and beyond. We build algorithms to analyze data. We also use theory as well as computational and [neural modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience) to understand how information is processed in the nervous system, explaining data obtained in collaboration with [electrophysiologists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrophysiology) and in [psychophysical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychophysics) experiments. Lastly, we constrain and develop new technologies aimed at obtaining data about brains.

Our conceptual work addresses information processing in the nervous system from two angles: (1) By analyzing and explaining electrophysiological data, we study what neurons do. (2) By analyzing and explaining human behavior, we study what all these neurons do together. Much of our work looks at these questions from a normative or causal viewpoint, asking what problems the nervous system should be solving. This often means taking a Bayesian approach. Bayesian decision theory is the systematic way of calculating how the nervous system may make good decisions in the presence of uncertainty. Causal inference from observational data promises to be a key enabler for progress in science.

We've pursued projects that involve handshake greetings, human movement, [cell-phone related parkinson's research](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fneur.2012.00158/abstract), competitions at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), [meta-science analysis](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v489/n7415/full/489201a.html), data sharing initiatives, and [recording from all neurons in a mouse](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002291).

The best way to get a sense of what's currently going on in the lab is to check out the work of individual lab members:
