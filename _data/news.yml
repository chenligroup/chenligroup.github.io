    Pathological morphology analysis is the gold standard for clinical diagnosis of many major diseases, including malignant tumors, and is an important clinical evidence for studying tumor evolution and key molecular functions. Manual diagnosis is far from being able to meet the demand for quantitative analysis of massive cell morphology in pathology images. Therefore, artificial intelligence has become an important technical support to improve the efficiency of pathology diagnosis and reveal the evolution of diseases. The team has carried out intelligent recognition and assisted diagnosis for the morphology of various cells in bone marrow images, and through sufficient training with high-quality and large-sample data, the system's diagnostic accuracy has reached the level of chief physician.
