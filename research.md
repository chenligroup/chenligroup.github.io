## Our Research Areas
We focuses on the following research areas:
1. Clinical structured data analysis
    - Utilizing deep learning algorithms to build clinical decision support models for common clinical prediction tasks based on multimodal clinical structured data
    - Addressing complex clinical application scenarios, including limited data, data missingness, and pattern incompleteness
    - Investigating algorithm implementation-related issues such as uncertainty estimation, interpretability, and reliability
    - Published multiple papers on this topic in international conferences or journals such as KDD, ICDM, SDM, and Big Data Journal

2. Digital pathology image analysis
    - Designing and developing computer vision algorithms and computer-aided diagnosis techniques for integrating digital pathology slides into the pathology workflow
    - Expanding pathologists' perspectives beyond microscopic slides
    - Utilizing and integrating existing human medical knowledge to discover pathological phenotypes and human genotypes
    - Uncovering medical and life information that transcends human cognition

3. Pathology semantic standardization
    - Constructing large-scale knowledge graphs as the core task
    - Researching information extraction, coreference resolution, sentiment analysis, and intelligent question answering etc.
    - Actively exploring effective methods for acquiring and applying valuable human knowledge
    - Providing strong support for downstream tasks such as information retrieval, question answering, and recommendation systems

4. Deep learning methods on clinical data
    - Image processing methods alone are insufficient for comprehensive pathology analysis and diagnosis
    - Expanding beyond pixel-level analysis to incorporate pathological knowledge and inference-drawing capabilities
    - Building a pathological semantic system for a unified representation of pathological knowledge
    - Enabling computers to perceive and analyze the underlying knowledge behind pathology data
    - Uncovering hidden, immutable laws through computational analysis   

## We are doing
1. Development of natural language processing and bioinformatics-based text mining AI algorithms
2. Construction of structured biomedical knowledge graphs from unstructured biomedical and clinical data
3. Research in the field of healthcare big data, utilizing large-scale data mining and machine learning algorithms for in-depth analysis
4. Application of artificial intelligence techniques to assist doctors in diagnosis and treatment processes
